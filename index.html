     <h6>WHAT DEFY SAYS</h6>
     <p> “Lindsay was by far the best investment I've made for my business! Working with her has been nothing short of an amazing experience. She is beyond organized, meticulous and an absolute creative genius. With her help, Defy was able to establish a brand that excites and includes everyone. I'm so proud of where she was able to take the brand, and am reminded of that every day. Her amazing work has since translated to skincare product labels, gift bags, office decor, tissue paper and even sweatshirts! These little details are what set Defy apart from other cosmetic providers and I have Lindsay to thank for that!”</p>
